kld-intersections
=================

A library of intersection algorithms covering all SVG shape types.

~~WARNING: Please note that the bézier intersections are not well-behaved. Unfortunately, over the past decade since I wrote this code, I have not been able to address those issues due to time constraints. I've made this code public in the hopes that someone with better math abilities than me might be able see what those issues are.~~

Install
-------
    npm install kld-intersections
